			Home Automation by using IoT


In the modern world, easy-to-access connectivity promotes information in a remote
and unstructured way, IoT is a leap providing great changes and many challenges,
social and technological, being a promising market with many technological challenges.
This project aims to use concepts and applications in a control and monitoring system
of energy consumption and security in a residence, using computers and mobile devices,
thus reducing the unnecessary consumption of electric energy, contributing to
the conscious and sustainable use, favoring the environment and the population. The
tool consumer is provided with precise and instantaneous data that allows conducts
to a program of consumption conscious of the available power, allowing conduits for a
schedule of expenses and measures of economy, providing objectives in the day to day,
making possible the exchange of information, leading to a real use of electricity, and
consequently cost savings.

This project was developed in Arduino's platform by using C programming language. As youÂ´re 
gonna see in src directory, two files in which have the coding of this project.
